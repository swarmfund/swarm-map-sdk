# Swarm Market Access Protocol SDK

The official Swarm Market Access Protocol for JavaScript, currently available for Node.js backends.

Market Access Protocol (MAP) is Swarmâ€™s investor compliance ecosystem, built and maintained by a decentralized network of nodes. MAP solves existing inefficiencies and difficulties encountered by token issuers, investors, exchanges, and certificate issuers.

# Installation

For use on Node.js backends, you can install the SDK by running the following NPM command:

```
npm install swarm-map-sdk --save
```

or if using yarn

```
yarn add swarm-map-sdk
```

# Documentation

For using the SDK and Swarm Market Access Protocol API please consult the [MAP Developer Docs](https://marketaccessprotocol.docs.apiary.io/#) and [examples](https://github.com/swarmfund/swarm-map-sdk/tree/master/examples).
